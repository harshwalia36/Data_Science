    "Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2. You are going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing \"Congratulations on the promotion! Lets get coffee and talk. Love you!\" the emojifier can automatically turn this into \"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Lets get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as \"Let's go see the baseball game tonight!\") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è). In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è is the \"heart\" symbol rather than the \"love\" symbol. But using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate words in the test set to the same emoji even if those words don't even appear in the training set. This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings, then build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we want to train Keras using mini-batches. However, most deep learning frameworks require that all sequences in the same mini-batch have the same length. This is what allows vectorization to work: If you had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 3 steps of an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it's just not possible to do them both at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common solution to this is to use padding. Specifically, set a maximum sequence length, and pad all sequences to the same length. For example, of the maximum sequence length is 20, we could pad every sentence with \"0\"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. Thus, a sentence \"i love you\" would be represented as $(e_{i}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \\vec{0}, \\vec{0}, \\ldots, \\vec{0})$. In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. One simple way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. \n"

    "### 2.3 - The Embedding layer\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, the embedding matrix is represented as a \"layer\", and maps positive integers (indices corresponding to words) into dense vectors of fixed size (the embedding vectors). It can be trained or initialized with a pretrained embedding. In this part, you will learn how to create an [Embedding()](https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) layer in Keras, initialize it with the GloVe 50-dimensional vectors loaded earlier in the notebook. Because our training set is quite small, we will not update the word embeddings but will instead leave their values fixed. But in the code below, we'll show you how Keras allows you to either train or leave fixed this layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Embedding()` layer takes an integer matrix of size (batch size, max input length) as input. This corresponds to sentences converted into lists of indices (integers), as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/embedding1.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:250px;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> **Figure 4**: Embedding layer. This example shows the propagation of two examples through the embedding layer. Both have been zero-padded to a length of `max_len=5`. The final dimension of the representation is  `(2,max_len,50)` because the word embeddings we are using are 50 dimensional. </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest integer (i.e. word index) in the input should be no larger than the vocabulary size. The layer outputs an array of shape (batch size, max input length, dimension of word vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to convert all your training sentences into lists of indices, and then zero-pad all these lists so that their length is the length of the longest sentence. \n",
    "\n",

    "- If you have an NLP task where the training set is small, using word embeddings can help your algorithm significantly. Word embeddings allow your model to work on words in the test set that may not even have appeared in your training set. \n",
    "- Training sequence models in Keras (and in most other deep learning frameworks) requires a few important details:\n",
    "    - To use mini-batches, the sequences need to be padded so that all the examples in a mini-batch have the same length. \n",
    "    - An `Embedding()` layer can be initialized with pretrained values. These values can be either fixed or trained further on your dataset. If however your labeled dataset is small, it's usually not worth trying to train a large pre-trained set of embeddings.   \n",
    "    - `LSTM()` has a flag called `return_sequences` to decide if you would like to return every hidden states or only the last one. \n",
    "    - You can use `Dropout()` right after `LSTM()` to regularize your network. \n"
